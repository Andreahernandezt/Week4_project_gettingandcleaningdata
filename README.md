# Week4_project_gettingandcleaningdata

This is the final assignment for Coursera's Getting and Cleaning Data course.

The run_analysis.R script:

-    Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
-   Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
-   Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
-   Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
-   From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
